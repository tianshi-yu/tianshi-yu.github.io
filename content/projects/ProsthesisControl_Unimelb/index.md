## Uncertainty-aware Prosthesis Control based on Bayesian Learning
Minimise the undesired prosthesis movement due to uncertainties during interaction with the environment. Reduce task completion time by compared to traditional approach (with statistical significance). 

* Developed the decision making system based on EMG and joint kinematics, as well as the real-time processing pipeline in Python.

* Validated in a dedicated VR experimental environment using Unity (C#) and VIVE headset, featuring high-frequency sensor data acuiqsition and real-time control system, code can be found here.

* Published in IEEE-TNSRE (Top journal in Assistive Robotics).

## Process-mining-based Framework for Human Intention Detection
Develop a reasoning framework for human intention detection leveraging process mining technique and petri-net. 

## Real-time Optimisation & Personalisation using Extremum Seeking Control
Enable real-time adjustment of controller parameters for optimal performance. Significantly reduced compensation of trunk and shoulder in task completion.
