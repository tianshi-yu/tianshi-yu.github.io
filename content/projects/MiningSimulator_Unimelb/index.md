## VR Platform for Studying Human-Autonomy Interaction

* Developed a universal VR platform using Unreal Engine (C++), simulating human-operated vehicle interacting with autonomous vehicles. Demo project can be found [here](https://github.com/tianshi-yu/HRVREP).

* Developed sensor data acquisition and logging system based on multithreading, including software interface with **VIVE Eye Tracker**, **XSens motion capture**, and a standalone Unreal Plugin for **Delsys EMG**. The plugin code can be found [here](https://github.com/tianshi-yu/HRVREP/tree/main/Plugins/DelsysTrignoEMG).

## Data-driven model for Human State Prediction 

* Developed machine learning models to predict human attention (gaze) and affective states (stress, trust, workload) using **Transformer** architectures in **PyTorch**, supporting human-centred adaptive VR training solutions for mining and maritime industry.
