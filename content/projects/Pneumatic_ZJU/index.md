## Pneumatic Engine (Air Motor) Test Rig
**Developed a pneumatic engine test rig at Zhejiang University, integrating torque, pressure, flow and temperature sensors, as well as Festo valves and actuators, with full system calibration and performance validation.**

* Programmed **STM32** using **bare-metal** for high-frequency sensor data acquisition and control system firmware. Peripherals utilised include DMA, ADC, SPI, I2C, UART, and GPIO.

* Designed and manufactured the mechanical system using **CAD** and **CNC**, including bearing, shaft, gear and mounting parts.
