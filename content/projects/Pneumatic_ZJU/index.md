## Pneumatic Engine (Air Motor) Test Rig
**Developed a pneumatic engine test rig at Zhejiang University with integrated torque, pressure, flow, and temperature sensors, along with Festo valves and actuators. The system underwent comprehensive calibration and performance validation.**

* Programmed **STM32** bare metal firmware for sensor data acquisition and control at rates up to **50 kHz**. Utilized peripherals include DMA, ADC, SPI, I2C, UART, and GPIO.

* Designed and manufactured mechanical components including bearings, shafts, gears, and mounting parts using **CAD** and **CNC** machining, ensuring tolerance and fit.
