## Serial Manipulator Robotic System
I served as **Head Tutor** for MCEN90028 Robotics Systems at the University of Melbourne from 2020 to 2024. I received First-Class Honours (H1) as a student in 2019. Subject content included robot kinematics (DH parameters), differential kinematics (Jacobian), dynamics, and closed-loop control systems.

I delivered technical material to students at a range of levels and mentored postgraduate students on robot prototyping projects, including mechanical design, component selection, embedded system design, and programming.
